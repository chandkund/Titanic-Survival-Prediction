# ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Prediction Project

## Overview

Welcome to the **Titanic Survival Prediction** project! ðŸŒŠ This project aims to predict the likelihood of survival of passengers on the Titanic using various machine learning models. By analyzing different features such as passenger class, gender, age, and more, we seek to understand the factors that influenced survival rates during this historic disaster.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project is derived from the Titanic passenger list. It includes the following key features:

- **PassengerId**: A unique identifier for each passenger.
- **Survived**: The target variable, where `1` indicates the passenger survived, and `0` indicates they did not.
- **Pclass**: The class of the passenger (1st, 2nd, or 3rd).
- **Name**: The full name of the passenger.
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger.
- **Age**: Age of the passenger.
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings or spouses aboard the Titanic.
- **Parch**: Number of parents or children aboard the Titanic.
- **Ticket**: The ticket number.
- **Fare**: The fare paid by the passenger.
- **Cabin**: The cabin number.
- **Embarked**: The port where the passenger boarded the Titanic.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Exploration**: 
   - Analyzed the dataset to understand the distribution and significance of features.
   - Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and correlations.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and outliers.
   - Encoded categorical variables and scaled numerical features for optimal model performance.

3. **Model Building**:
   - Implemented and compared multiple machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines.
   - Tuned hyperparameters to improve model accuracy and reliability.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Assessed the models using metrics such as accuracy.
   - Selected the best-performing model for predicting Titanic survival.

## Results

The final model achieved an impressive accuracy of **81%**, demonstrating the significant impact of factors like passenger class, gender, and age on survival chances.

## Conclusion

This project highlights the power of machine learning in uncovering patterns and making predictions based on historical data. The insights from this analysis could provide valuable lessons in risk management and emergency preparedness.
